# LootChance
A loot drop chance simulator, written in C++.

The program is designed to simulate loot drops of an item over a series of chests. It tests only for if a drop occured, rather than the sum total of drops. Randomness achieved through a modified xorshift, passing in time as a "seed" of sorts.
